# AIENG Version / Compatibility Contract

This document defines the version surface and compatibility policy for the
three surfaces an external agent binds to when connecting to the AIENG
Workbench:

1. **MCP tool surface** — tool names and input/output shapes.
2. **`.aieng` / artifact schemas** — the JSON schemas used by packages and
   runtime artifacts.
3. **Skill prompts** — the agent skill instructions shipped in
   `aieng-agent-skills/`.

## Version surface

The canonical version surface is stored in
`aieng/src/aieng/schemas/version_surface.json`. It is exposed read-only to
connected agents via the `aieng.agent_readme` tool (`version_surface` field).

Example:

```json
{
  "format": "aieng.version_surface.v1",
  "version": "0.1.0-alpha.1",
  "surfaces": {
    "mcp_tool_surface": {
      "version": "0.1.0-alpha.1",
      "policy": "unstable",
      "sha256": "..."
    },
    "artifact_schemas": {
      "version": "0.1.0-alpha.1",
      "policy": "unstable",
      "sha256": "..."
    },
    "skill_prompts": {
      "version": "0.1.0-alpha.1",
      "policy": "unstable",
      "sha256": "..."
    }
  },
  "compat_policy": { ... }
}
```

Agents should record the surface version/hash at session start and compare it
to a known-good value. A mismatch means the contract may have drifted and the
agent should re-inspect the tools/schemas/prompts before relying on them.

## Compatibility policy (alpha)

During the `0.1.0-alpha` period the contract declares itself **unstable**.
Breaking changes are allowed, but they must be deliberate and detectable:

- **Breaking change** examples:
  - MCP tool surface: renaming/removing a tool, removing or retyping a required
    parameter, tightening `additionalProperties`.
  - Artifact schemas: removing a schema, removing a required field, or changing
    a field type in a way that invalidates existing packages.
  - Skill prompts: removing a skill, changing a skill's MCP tool contract, or
    changing prompt instructions that agents depend on.
- **Additive change** examples:
  - MCP tool surface: adding a new tool or adding optional parameters to an
    existing tool.
  - Artifact schemas: adding a new schema or adding optional fields to an
    existing schema.
  - Skill prompts: adding a new skill or adding clarifying guidance that does
    not change tool usage.

There is **no deprecation window during alpha**. When a breaking change lands,
the relevant surface `version` must be bumped and `version_surface.json` must
be regenerated.

## Regenerating the version surface

After changing any tool schema, artifact schema, or skill prompt, run:

```bash
python scripts/update_version_surface.py
```

If the change is breaking, manually bump the affected surface `version` in
`aieng/src/aieng/schemas/version_surface.json` before committing. The
anti-drift gate (`pytest aieng/tests/test_backend_stability_gate.py`) will fail
if the stored SHA256 hashes do not match the current artifacts.

## Using the version surface in an external agent

A typical external agent flow:

1. Call `aieng.agent_readme` at session start.
2. Read `version_surface` from the response.
3. Compare `version_surface.surfaces.*.sha256` against a pinned or cached
   value.
4. If any hash differs, re-list tools (`mcp.list_tools`) and re-read the
   relevant schemas/prompts before constructing tool calls.

Do not rely on the surface being frozen during alpha; rely on it being
*detectable*.
