"""Pure, deterministic engineering critique engine.

This module contains the geometry/topology audit logic behind
``cad.critique`` without any project/backend coupling.  It reads a
topology_map + feature_graph and returns structured manufacturing-rule
findings so both the interactive CAD tool and batch design-study
evaluation can share one source of truth.
