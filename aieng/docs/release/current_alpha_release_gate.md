# Current Alpha Release Gate

Status: **owner-action gate, not an automatic release**.

This note reconciles the current repository state with the open release trackers
[#152](https://github.com/armpro24-blip/cad-cae-copilot/issues/152) and
[#273](https://github.com/armpro24-blip/cad-cae-copilot/issues/273). It is a
pre-tag checklist for the current `main` line, not a historical release-branch
record.

## Already Evidenced On Main

- CI, packaging smoke, and Docker smoke are green on recent release-gate work.
- The GHCR Docker path exists for the all-in-one workbench image:
  `ghcr.io/armpro24-blip/aieng-workbench:latest` plus immutable `sha-*` tags.
- Packaged Docker/MCP dogfood evidence exists under
  `docs/dogfood/issue-179-packaged-external-agent.md`.
- The review handoff path is present:
  `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/review-support-packet/preview` and
  `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/review-support-packet/export`.
- The Web Workbench exposes the review packet export entry point.

## Still Owner-Gated

These actions must be performed by a human owner with the relevant package and
release credentials. Do not infer completion from green CI alone.

1. Publish `aieng-format` and `aieng-workbench-mcp` to TestPyPI or PyPI as
   explicit alpha/pre-release artifacts.
2. Verify clean installs from the published artifacts, outside the source tree.
3. Update install snippets only after the real published artifact names and
   versions are confirmed.
4. Record baseline embedding-depth metrics.
5. Create the `v0.1.0-alpha` or chosen alpha tag and GitHub release notes from
   the exact green release commit.

## Minimum Pre-Tag Verification

Run from the repository root unless noted.

```bash
python scripts/update_version_surface.py --check
python -m pytest aieng-ui/backend/tests/test_review_support_packet.py -q
python -m pytest aieng-ui/backend/tests/test_aieng_package_handoff_runbook.py -q
python -m pytest aieng-ui/backend/tests/test_value_demo_packet.py -q
```

Then confirm the remote checks for the tag candidate commit:

```bash
gh run list --branch main --limit 10
```

Required remote workflows for the release commit:

- CI
- Packaging smoke
- Docker smoke, when the release includes the Docker published-image path

## Post-Publish Install Verification

Use a clean environment and published artifact path. Replace versions with the
actual published alpha versions.

```bash
python -m venv .tmp-alpha-install
.tmp-alpha-install\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.tmp-alpha-install\Scripts\python -m pip install --pre aieng-format==<published-alpha>
.tmp-alpha-install\Scripts\python -m pip install --pre aieng-workbench-mcp==<published-alpha>
.tmp-alpha-install\Scripts\python -c "import aieng; print(aieng.FORMAT_VERSION)"
.tmp-alpha-install\Scripts\python -c "from importlib.resources import files; print(files('aieng.schemas').joinpath('manifest.schema.json').is_file())"
```

For Docker:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/armpro24-blip/aieng-workbench:<release-tag-or-sha-tag>
```

## Embedding-Depth Baseline

Record the first baseline immediately after publication. Unknown values are
acceptable at tag time, but they should be explicit rather than silently omitted.

| Signal | Baseline value | Source | Date |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `aieng-format` published installs/downloads | unknown | PyPI/TestPyPI stats or owner note | TBD |
| `aieng-workbench-mcp` published installs/downloads | unknown | PyPI/TestPyPI stats or owner note | TBD |
| GHCR pulls | unknown | GHCR package page or owner note | TBD |
| External-agent packaged-path runs | 1+ expected | dogfood evidence packet | TBD |
| `.aieng` packages created from published path | unknown | dogfood/project evidence | TBD |

## Honesty Boundary

This gate does not certify engineering correctness, solver validity, or CAD
modeling quality. It only records whether the alpha artifacts are installable,
auditable, and externally dogfoodable.
